# Introduction

- two broad classifications:
  - Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning



## Supervised Learning

- definition:

  data set called "right answers" are given

- category:

  - regression problem（回归问题）

    map input variables to some continuous function

  - classification problem

    map input variables into discrete categories



## Unsupervised Learning

​    unlabled data set

​    We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data

- examples:
  - Clustering: Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.
  - Non-clustering: The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a [cocktail party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)).
